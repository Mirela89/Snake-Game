# Snake-Game

The Snake Game, an iconic and timeless classic in the world of video games, originated in the mid-1970s. The simple yet addictive gameplay involves controlling a snake that grows in length as it consumes food, while avoiding collisions with itself. Over the years, this game has seen numerous adaptations and remains a popular choice for developers and hobbyists exploring programming and game design on platforms like Arduino. This enduring game continues to captivate players with its straightforward mechanics and nostalgic charm.

I selected the Snake Game for its sentimental valueâ€”it reminds me of my childhood when I spent countless hours immersed in this classic on my trusty Nokia 3310. The decision to implement this game was made because I wanted to relive those nostalgic moments. This project not only pays homage to a beloved pastime but also serves as a personal journey down memory lane, rekindling the joy and simplicity of early mobile gaming.

# How to play

On the matrix display, the snake moves around the screen without stopping, eating food and getting longer. The user can steer the snake in any direction using the joystick. If the snake collides into itself, that means the game is over, in which case the game stops and a message is displayed on the LCD Display. It is a simple yet entertaining game that can be played by anyone, no matter the age.
